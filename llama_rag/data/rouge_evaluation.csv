1. Wind-blown rain: BLB can be transmitted through wind-blown rain, which can carry bacterial spores from infected plants to healthy ones.
2. Irrigation water: BLB can also be spread through contaminated irrigation water, which can carry bacterial spores from one field to another.
3. Contaminated seeds: BLB can be transmitted through contaminated seeds, which can harbor bacterial spores.
4. Tools: BLB can also be spread through the use of contaminated tools, such as pruning shears or watering cans, that have come into contact with infected plants.
5. Airborne spores: BLB can also spread through airborne spores, which can travel long distances and infect healthy plants.
6. Infected plant debris or seeds: BLB can also be spread through infected plant debris or seeds, which can harbor bacterial spores.
